-The Event Loop:
   > the model of execution that JS uses
   > consists of call stack and message queue
   > call stacks is used to track in progress tasks, queue stores messages that cant be
   > executed b/c stack is busy, once it's free messages will be executed


-The Message Queue:
   > items stored on the message queue are called "messages"
   > when a new event occurs, but runtime is busy processing another command, a msg for that event is enqueued
   > when runttime finishes its current command, nxt msq is dequeued and processed
