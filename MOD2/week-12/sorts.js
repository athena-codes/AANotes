/*
-- Bubble sort (adjacent pairs)

--Insertion sort
    - compares current key ele to its predecessor to sort, if it's
    less than then it moves to the front

--Selection Sort (swapping min index)
   -continually looks for min ele and swaps whatever is smaller
   with the prev index (set curr index to 0, then curr index increases
    by one each time)

-- Quick sort (pivot, partition)
   - divide + conquer, pivot can be first, last, median or random
   - takes pivot ele and partitions other eles (whichever ones are less than pivot)
   and starts to swap placement of eles based on value
